### Foundation Library
Foundation lib is a free open source product that contains lots of useful APIs, Utilities and Extension methods. We do not provide any articles or tutorials for these plugins. But we do try to keep every public API documented and self-explanatory.

### IOS Native Pro
The plugin gives you an ability to directly use `iOS` and `watchOS` API, to make your application feel more natural and friendly for the users. It contains all kinds of native APIs for the iOS platform you can think of and even more :). We do not want you to learn "another 3rd party plugin" API, that's why per our [API Convention](https://github.com/StansAssets/com.stansassets.ios-native/wiki#api-convention) plugin API is mirroring the Apple official `Objective-C` API in a `CSharp-ish` manner. 

The plugin also comes with advanced post-processing (no more altering XCode project after the build) and fully modular structure (allows you to include in the build things you are using.)

### Android Native Pro
The Android plugin follows the same principles as the iOS plugin above. Tons of features, mimics Google official API, modular structure, advanced post-processing. But on top of that, we ultimately realize how hard it is to manage even a few 3rd party android plugins in the project.  That's why we put a lot of effort to make your life simpler. The plugin won't mess with your main `AndroidManifest.xml`, it can work out of the box as well as relay on [unity-jar-resolver](https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver), all plugin files are inside one folder to keep your project clean and organized and a lot more!

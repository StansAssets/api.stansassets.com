# Extended Facebook SDK 
Power up your Unity project with our Extended Facebook SDK. This library is a free open source product that contains extended access to Facebook API. We want to make life a little bit easier for all of our fellow developers. Facebook already provides [Facebook Unity SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/unity/) but it only covers basic functionality. And if you would like to use [Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/) you will have to do all the parsing yourself. And this is the exact part where we would like to help.
